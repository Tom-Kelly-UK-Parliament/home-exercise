  <h1>UK Parliament - Product Team Developer Home Exercise</h1>
  <p>Thanks for taking the time to do our recruitment home exercise</p>
</div>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>We'd like you to make a (very!) small person manager app - it doesn't have to be complicated!</p>

<h2>Assessment criteria</h2>
<p><strong>You should have been provided an assessment criteria for the exercise separately.</strong> You should aim to satisfy all the points on it as this will be referenced when reviewing your completed exercise.</p>

<h2>Project</h2>
<p>We've setup a template project for you. It includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An Angular frontend embedded in a .Net web application (all UI components should be implemented in Angular)</li>
  <li>The beginning of an API - A person API controller exists for you, and the proxy.config has been set for the /api route. See home.component.ts for a very basic example of calling the API</li>
  <li>Services assembly - To contain any services you might require</li>
  <li>Data assembly - Houses the in-memory database context with simple Person and Department models. The Departments are seeded into the database in application startup.</li>
  <li>Test assembly - For tests!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Expected completed solution</h2>
<p>What should the finished exercise look like?</p>
<p>When you've finished this exercise these instructions should be gone. In their place should be a very simple person management app:</p>
<p>Please remove the home component and add your own components, or if you prefer, use routing to provide a link to go to your person manager app page</p>
<p>The application should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Show a list of people</li>
  <li>Allow the person to be loaded into an editor which could sit to the side of the list</li>
  <li>Allow a user to update the person properties and save them</li>
  <li>Allow a user to add more people to the list</li>
</ul>
<p>More detailed instructions are below</p>

<h2>Detailed instructions</h2>
<p>To complete this exercise please modify this solution and do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extend the person model in the data assembly to include these properties:
  <ul>
    <li>First name</li>
    <li>Last name</li>
    <li>Date of birth</li>
    <li>Department (should be a dropdown allowing one of the seeded Departments to be selected)</li>
    <li>Anything else you'd like to add!</li>
  </ul>
  <li>All fields should be mandatory, and validated appropriately</li>
  <li>Remove / rename the home component and replace it with your own set of semantically meaningful components</li>
  <li>Display a list of people</li>
  <li>People in the list can be selected and load into a simple editor</li>
  <li>An editor is available next to the list - all properties should be editable (apart from Id!)</li>
  <li>Allow new people to be added to the list</li>
  <li>Add the ability to save updates to existing people</li>
  <li>When a user saves a person record, persist this in the in-memory database. (No need for a real relational backend)</li>
  <li>If you'd like to you could add other functionality, such as the ability to delete a person etc, but this isn't required</li>
  <li>Please pay consideration to the visual design and accessibility of the finished product</li>
</ul>
